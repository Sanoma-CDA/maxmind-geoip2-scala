/**
 * This is a simple Scala wrapper around the MaxMind Java geo lookup class:
 * https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-java
 * I.e. it uses the new Beta API.
 * Download the database from http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-City.mmdb.gz
 *
 * Inspired by https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip
 *
 * Note that some of the location are not trustworthy. In some countries, it seems that MaxMind assigns
 * certain geoPoint to IP addresses that are known to be in the country, but not more accurately.
 * Seems that you could make a filter based on this accurate location, however, to enable more accurate control,
 * this was changed to a function that takes in IpLocation and decides what to do with it.
 *
 * @param dbInputStream The DB file unzipped
 * @param lruCache The Size of the LRU cache
 * @param synchronized Use synchronized (true) for multithreaded environments
 * @param postFilterIpLocation Optional function that analyzes the IpLocation and possible changes the field values - completely for convenience
